            <span class="space">The</span> Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle involving three rods and a number of disks of varying sizes. Initially, all disks are stacked on one rod in descending order of size, with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top. <br><br>
            <span class="space">The</span> goal is to move the entire stack to another rod, following these rules:<br>
            <span class="space" style="font-weight: 900;">1.</span> Only one disk can be moved at a time.<br>
            <span class="space" style="font-weight: 900;">2.</span> Each move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on another rod.<br>
            <span class="space" style="font-weight: 900;">3.</span> A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.<br><br>
            <span class="space">The</span> Tower of Hanoi puzzle is often used to teach problem-solving and recursive thinking, as it can be solved efficiently using recursion.
            The minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle with ùëõ disks is  <br>
