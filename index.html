            <span class="space" >The</span> Tower of Hanoi <span class="or">(</span>also called The problem of Benares Temple <span class="or">or</span> Tower of Brahma <span class="or">or</span> Luca's Tower and sometimes pluralized as Towers <span class="or">or</span> simply pyramid puzzle <span class="or">)</span>
            is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod.
            The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. <br>
            <span class="rules" style="text-align: center;">
                <span class="space" style="line-height: 60px;">The</span> objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following <span class="rule">rules</span>:<br>
                <span style="margin-left: 50px;" class="spac">1.</span>Only one disk may be moved at a time. <br> 
                <span style="margin-left: 50px;" class="spac">2.</span>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. <br>
                <span style="margin-left: 50px;" class="spac">3.</span>No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
            </span><br><br>
            
            <span class="space">The</span> minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is <span class="formu">2^n - 1</span>, where <span class="n">n</span> is the number of disks.

        <p class="history">Origin :</p>
        <p class="orgin">
            <span class="space">The</span> puzzle was invented by the French mathematician <span class="names"> Édouard Lucas</span>, first presented in <span class="year"> 1883</span> as a game discovered by <br><span class="names">"N. Claus (de Siam)"</span> , and later published as a booklet in <span class="year"> 1889 </span>and in a posthumously-published volume of Lucas' Récréations mathématiques.
             Accompanying the game was an instruction booklet, describing the game's purported origins in Tonkin, and claiming that according to legend Brahmins at a temple in Benares have been carrying out the movement of the "Sacred Tower of Brahma", 
            consisting of sixty-four golden disks, according to the same rules as in the game, and that the completion of the tower would lead to the end of the world.
             Numerous variations on this legend regarding the ancient and mystical nature of the puzzle popped up almost immediately.

                <span class="space">If</span> the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, 
                using the smallest number of moves, it would take them 2^64 − 1 seconds or roughly 585 billion years to finish,
                 which is about 42 times the estimated current age of the universe. <br><br>
                <span class="space">There</span> are many variations on this legend. For instance, in some tellings, the temple is a monastery, and the priests are monks. The temple or monastery may be in various locales including Hanoi, and may be associated with any religion. In some versions, other elements are introduced, such as the fact that the tower was created at the beginning of the world, or that the priests or monks may make only one move per day.
